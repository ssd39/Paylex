## Whatâ€™s PayLex

Paylex is revolutionizing merchant-customer interaction with single swipe payments.

Paylex equally values customers as well as merchants and hence we have created a product in which we try to maxmize revenue for the merchants by allowing them to accept payments in a single swipe safely with the power of rapid checkout toolkit while the customers can deposit certain amount and earn interest while getting a hassle free buying experience.
